\textbf{POLICIES}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Acknowledgments: \/} 
  We expect you to make an honest effort to solve the problems individually.  As we sometimes reuse problem set questions from previous years, covered by papers and web pages, we expect the students \textbf{NOT} to copy, refer to, or look at the solutions in preparing their answers (relating to an unauthorized material is considered a violation of the honor principle). Similarly, we expect you not to google directly for answers (though you are free to google for knowledge about the topic). If you do happen to use other material, it must be acknowledged in \texttt{README.md}, with a citation on the submitted solution.
  
\item {\bf Required homework submission format: \/} 
  You should submit the assignment by the invitation link \url{https://classroom.github.com/a/unEXjpJv}. This link will create a private GitHub repository from the code template.
  Push your modification to the master branch and view the auto-grading results afterwards. The teaching assistant will grade your
  assignment mainly based on the rightness of your programming implementation.
  Optionally you can write your ideas in \texttt{README.md} or in code comments.
  

\item {\bf Collaborators: \/}
If you collaborated with others, in \texttt{README.md}, list their names and GitHub ID and for which question(s).
